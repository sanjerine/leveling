## What exactly is a muscle?

It is crucial for any gym-person to have a rudimentary understanding of muscles. After all, we will be dedicating so much time to our pursuit of growing them - we want to know how they work!

Everyone knows that muscles are soft tissues in your body made up of stretchy fibres. There are many types of muscles in the body, which all have different functions. However, when we refer to muscles here we talk about skeletal muscles - these are the muscles that attach to your skeleton (spooky) and control movement. There are other muscles than control your organs, for example, but we don’t need to worry about those.

 The muscles we're interested in growing are the **skeletal** muscles, which largely support movement.

Each muscle in the human body has a specific purpose (or purposes). Every single one. There are no ‘useless’ muscles, else they would have atrophied long ago and we would not have evolved to still have them in our body.

Muscles support movement by shortening and lengthening (‘contracting’). When a muscle is at its shortest, it is in a ‘shortened’ position. At its longest, it is in a ‘lengthened’ position. It 'contracts' when moving from its lengthened to shortened position.

Muscles often work together with other muscles (collectively known as muscle groups) to carry out a specific function, or support a certain movement. When this happens, all the muscles in the group collectively contract (shorten) to support said movement.

Let’s take the humble push up, for example. When we lower down to the ground, the muscles in our chest and triceps (among others) lengthen. Even now, if you just pull your arm back as far as it can go to simulate the bottom position of a pushup, you will feel your chest stretch. When we start ‘pushing up’, the muscles in our chest and triceps shorten to produce movement.
