  - creatine 5g a day
  - protein powders are just protein rich foods. add them if you don't eat enough food but otherwise 
  - you dont need bcaas/eaas unless you don't eat complete proteins (vegan, vegetarian etc). 
  - pre workout/caffeine is optional, but can help make ur workouts better/more fun! just make sure to cycle caffeine every few months so u dont work up a tolerance
