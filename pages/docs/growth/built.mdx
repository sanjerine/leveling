## Hypertrophy and Mechanical Tension

Our time at the gym will be driven in the pursuit of something known as **hypertrophy**. 

### Hypertrophy

So what is hypertrophy?

This buzz-word simply means the growth and increase of muscle cells. It’s very important! Just think, in your head, hypertrophy = growing muscles. I’ll be using it a lot throughout this guide! The world of fitness is much more than just hypertrophy, but in terms of our goals of working out to look good, we don’t really need to concern ourselves with much else.

You may have heard many, many different statements regarding the ‘best’ way to build muscle - that is, the best way to induce hypertrophy:

_‘High reps for toning, low reps for strength!’_

_‘Muscles need to be broken down, so that they can be built up again stronger.’_

_‘You need to use higher reps so you can get a pump. This will help build the muscles!’_

_‘Use compound movements. They are much better for hypertrophy.’_

In truth, there is only one way muscle is ever built. Many of these claims only work because they are correlated with this one factor. Hypertrophy is driven solely, or at least very majorly, by **mechanical tension**.

### Mechanical Tension

What is mechanical tension, you may ask? Mechanical tension is simply a force that your muscles experience when they try to shorten or lengthen. 

For instance, let's say you try to do a bicep curl. As you perform the concentric portion of the curl (curling up), your bicep shortens, and it experiences a tension force - this force is mechanical tension. In day to day life, gravity is the force most responsible for mechanical tension on muscles - but we are largely strong enough to contract our muscles through gravity, and so our muscle cells do not signal to our body that they need to increase or grow in size.

In essence, we need to make our muscles experience high degrees of mechanical tension; high enough to make our body go 'okay, we're going to need to put on more muscle'. 

Our muscles experience the highest degrees of mechanical tension according to something known as the force-velocity curve.

In essence, what this is telling us is that our muscles experience the highest degree of mechanical tension when they are involuntarily moving the slowest. Imagine a large, jacked individual, ‘squeezing out’ the last few repetitions of an exercise. They will be moving slowly, right? There is no way the speed of the first rep matches the speed of the last rep. That’s the muscles experiencing high levels of mechanical tension. The research has shown that in any set, the last 5 or so repetitions are the most stimulating for hypertrophy. These sets will be the ones in closest proximity to failure. The rest - the reps far from failure - are known as ‘junk reps’, or ‘junk volume’.

 In essence, growing muscle comes down to **training to failure**.

When we resistance train, this force of mechanical tension is often due to an external load (unless we’re doing calisthenics). 

Let me spell it out for you. When we expose our muscles to abnormal levels of mechanical tension, it signals to our body that they need to grow! So it makes sense to continually expose our body to abnormal levels of mechanical tension. This introduces a concept known as progressive overload.

### Progressive overload

Progressive overload is simply, over time, doing more. This might mean more repetitions, or more weight on a particular exercise. Progressive overload is continually exposing our muscles to the same levels of mechanical tension. 

Our bodies are adaptive machines. To grow bigger muscles, we need to signal to our body that we _need_ bigger muscles.

But as a muscle grows and gets stronger, it is able to handle the same loads or weights without experiencing as much mechanical tension. So we’ll need to continually aim to lift higher and higher weights, or lift these heavy weights for higher and higher reps. 

Progressive overload, ensuring we are training to failure, should be our number one goal in the gym.

### Debunking common 'hypertrophy' myths

Some common factors which do **not** improve hypertrophy are:

- Time Under Tension (TUT)
- Accumulating metabolic stress
- Doing more sets or higher reps
- Muscles need to be 'confused'
- Dropsets (when compared to doing straight sets)
